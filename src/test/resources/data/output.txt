Publishing your documentation with WebHelp Responsive using GitHub Actions How to use GitHub actions in order to build documentation and deploy it to Netlify How to use GitHub Actions to run a WebHelp Responsive transformation How to use GitHub Actions workflows in order to build documentation in WebHelp Responsive format Access "Actions" tab in your repository on GitHub Press "New workflow" button in the left side of the page Choose "Simple workflow" template and press "Configure" button Delete the whole content of the file and let's begin writing our workflow Firstly, we'll give a name for our workflow name: CI Then we have to add some triggers when workflow will be executed name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master Let's write our job, we have to specify the name and the version of the OS name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build-dita-and-deploy-netlify:
    name: Build DITA WebHelp Responsive and deploy to Netlify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest The first step of the job will be to checkout the current branch of repository so it can access repository files name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build-dita-and-deploy-netlify:
    name: Build DITA WebHelp Responsive and deploy to Netlify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 Create a file containing licensekey.txt so we can use WebHelp Responsive plugin for DITA-OT, we'll take it from repository secrets name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build-dita-and-deploy-netlify:
    name: Build DITA WebHelp Responsive and deploy to Netlify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Extract license from secrets
        run: |
          echo "$OPE_LICENSE" > licensekey.txt
        env:
          OPE_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.OPE_LICENSE }} Then we have to download the engine name: CI

            sudo apt-get install unzip
            sudo unzip oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x-25.0-SNAPSHOT-package-full.zip
            sudo cp licensekey.txt oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x/licensekey.txt Upon downloading unzip it by adding these commands(newline) sudo apt-get install unzip
sudo unzip oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x-25.0-SNAPSHOT-package-full.zip Finally, copy the licensekey.txt file we created into root folder of engine by adding this line sudo cp licensekey.txt oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x/licensekey.txt The last step will be to build the documentation by using dita.bat. Go to oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x/bin - name: Build WebHelp Responsive
        run: |
            cd oxygen-publishing-engine-3.x/bin Add this line in order to get documentation built sudo ./dita --input=inputPath --format=webhelp-responsive -Dwebhelp.publishing.template=../../templates/webhelp-documentation-template --output=outputPath Our final workflow should look like this name: CI
